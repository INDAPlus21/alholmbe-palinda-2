1. What happens if you switch the order of the statements wgp.Wait() and close(ch) in the end of the main function?
- program doesn't work because we are trying to send values to a closed channel

2. What happens if you move the close(ch) from the main function and instead close the channel in the end of the function Produce?
- same as #1 but we are going to get it after a while instead of instantly.

3. What happens if you remove the statement close(ch) completely?
- Program works as expected, I suspect that Go handles the closing of the channel in the background. 

What happens if you increase the number of consumers from 2 to 4?
- We get a performance improvement, since we are doing more stuff concurrently.

Can you be sure that all strings are printed before the program stops?
- nope, since we are only waiting for the producers to finish. Need to wait for the consumers aswell to be sure.
